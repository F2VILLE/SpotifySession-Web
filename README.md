# Spotify Hession

This project is a simple web application to do Spotify Sessions with your friends that don't have spotify premium (or spotify at all).
You start the app, login with your account, then share the link with your friends. With the web interface, they can search for music, add them to the queue, and manage pause / play / skip.

## Setup

```bash
git clone git@github.com:F2VILLE/SpotifySession-Web.git && cd SpotifySession-Web
npm install
```

## Run

```bash
npm start
```
